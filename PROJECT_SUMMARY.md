## 🎯 What It Does

### 1. **Continuous Scanning**
- Fetches 200+ binary markets from Polymarket (public API)
- Fetches 200+ binary markets from Kalshi (authenticated API)
- Runs every 5 minutes (configurable)

### 2. **Smart Matching**
- Uses fuzzy string matching to find equivalent events
- Example: "Will Bitcoin hit $100k?" ↔ "Bitcoin to reach $100,000"
- Configurable similarity threshold (default 85%)

### 3. **Arbitrage Detection**
- Compares prices across platforms
- Calculates if you can profit regardless of outcome
- Accounts for platform fees:
  - Polymarket: ~2%
  - Kalshi: ~7%

### 4. **Profit Optimization**
- Calculates optimal bet distribution
- Ensures minimum $100 profit (configurable)
- Equalizes profit across both outcomes

### 5. **Instant Alerts**
- Sends detailed email with:
  - Exact bet amounts for each platform
  - Expected profit in both scenarios
  - Direct links to markets
  - ROI calculations

## 📊 Example Scenario

**Market Found:**
- Polymarket: "Will Bitcoin reach $100k in 2025?" - YES at 40¢
- Kalshi: "Bitcoin $100k in 2025" - NO at 55¢

**Arbitrage Detected:**
- After accounting for fees, you can profit both ways!

**Your Email Alert:**
```
🚨 Arbitrage Alert: $105.50 Profit!

Bet $485.00 on YES (Polymarket)
Bet $515.00 on NO (Kalshi)
Total: $1000

If YES: $105.50 profit
If NO: $105.50 profit
ROI: 10.55%
```

**You execute both bets, then:**
- If Bitcoin hits $100k → Polymarket pays you
- If Bitcoin doesn't hit $100k → Kalshi pays you
- **Either way, you profit $105.50!**

## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Install dependencies:**

   - See `GET_STARTED.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Test it:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --mode once
   ```

4. **Run continuously:**
   ```bash

MIN_PROFIT_USD=100              # Your requirement!

# Scanning frequency
SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5         # Every 5 minutes

# Platform fees (keep updated)
POLYMARKET_FEE=0.02            # 2%
KALSHI_FEE=0.07                # 7%

# Matching strictness
FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD=85       # 0-100, higher = stricter
```

python3 example_usage.py
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### What This System Does

✅ Detects arbitrage opportunities
✅ Calculates optimal bet amounts  
✅ Sends you detailed alerts
✅ Logs everything for analysis

### What This System Does NOT Do

❌ Place bets automatically (you do this manually)
❌ Guarantee you'll find arbitrage (it's rare!)
❌ Check account balances
❌ Verify liquidity depth
❌ Handle withdrawals

**You must manually:**
- Have funded accounts on both platforms
- Verify markets before betting
- Place the bets yourself (quickly!)
- Manage your own funds

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

1. **Not Financial Advice** - Educational tool only
2. **No Guarantees** - Markets change fast, execution risk exists
3. **Manual Verification Required** - Always double-check before betting
4. **Real Money** - Only bet what you can afford to lose
5. **Platform Risk** - Understand each platform's rules and fees

## 🎓 How Arbitrage Works

**Simple explanation:**

If Polymarket says 40% chance YES, but Kalshi says 60% chance NO...

Those don't add up! (40% + 60% = 100%, but should be more to account for fees)

You can bet YES on Polymarket and NO on Kalshi.
- If outcome is YES → Polymarket pays you
- If outcome is NO → Kalshi pays you

After accounting for fees, if there's still profit both ways = **ARBITRAGE!**

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- Modular design (easy to extend)
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Respects API rate limits
- Configurable via environment variables

**APIs Used:**
- Polymarket: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com` (public)
- Kalshi: `https://trading-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2` (authenticated)

**Dependencies:**
- `requests` - HTTP API calls
- `rapidfuzz` - Fuzzy string matching
- `schedule` - Task scheduling
- `python-dotenv` - Configuration
- `pytest` - Testing
