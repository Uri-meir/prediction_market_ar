## Understanding the Output

### Match Score
- **90-100%**: Excellent match, very likely the same event
- **85-90%**: Good match, worth checking
- **80-85%**: Borderline match, verify manually
- **Below 80%**: Not shown (filtered out)

### ROI (Return on Investment)
- **>15%**: Exceptional opportunity (rare!)
- **10-15%**: Strong opportunity
- **5-10%**: Good opportunity
- **<5%**: Marginal (might not be worth the effort)

### Investment Amounts

The system calculates bet amounts to **guarantee minimum profit** in both outcomes.

For MIN_PROFIT_USD=100:
- If YES wins: profit â‰¥ $100
- If NO wins: profit â‰¥ $100
- Usually one outcome profits slightly more (shown in email)

### What to Do When You Get an Alert

1. **Act quickly** - Prices change fast
2. **Verify manually** - Check both markets are still open
3. **Check current prices** - Ensure they haven't moved
4. **Verify liquidity** - Can the markets handle your bet size?
5. **Place bets simultaneously** - To minimize price movement risk
6. **Keep records** - Track your actual results vs predictions

## Tips for Interpreting Results

### "No arbitrage found" is NORMAL

Most scans won't find arbitrage because:
- Markets are efficient
- Fees eat into small price differences
- True arbitrage is rare

**Don't be discouraged!** The system will keep looking.

### When you DO find arbitrage

- **Verify everything** - Double-check the math yourself
- **Start small** - Test with minimum amounts first
- **Factor in ALL costs** - Withdrawal fees, deposit fees, taxes
- **Speed matters** - Arbitrage windows close quickly

### False Positives

Sometimes you might see "arbitrage" that isn't real:
- **Different event versions** - Slightly different resolution criteria
- **Different timeframes** - One market closes earlier
- **Liquidity issues** - Can't actually place the full bet amount
- **Withdrawal restrictions** - Can't easily access your money

Always manually verify before betting!
